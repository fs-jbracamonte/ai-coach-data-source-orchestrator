# If your password contains special characters, use one of these approaches:
# Option 1: Wrap in double quotes
DB_PASSWORD="your#password@with!special$chars"
# Option 2: Wrap in single quotes
# DB_PASSWORD='your#password@with!special$chars'
# Option 3: Escape with backslash (less common, depends on parser)
# DB_PASSWORD=your\#password
DB_DATABASE=your-database-name

# Examples of handling special characters in .env files:
# 
# For passwords with #:
# DB_PASSWORD="pass#word"     ✓ Works
# DB_PASSWORD='pass#word'     ✓ Works
# DB_PASSWORD=pass#word       ✗ Everything after # becomes a comment
#
# For passwords with spaces:
# DB_PASSWORD="pass word"     ✓ Works
# DB_PASSWORD='pass word'     ✓ Works
# DB_PASSWORD=pass word       ✗ Only "pass" is captured
#
# For passwords with quotes:
# DB_PASSWORD="pass\"word"    ✓ Escape double quotes inside double quotes
# DB_PASSWORD='pass"word'     ✓ Use single quotes if password has double quotes
# DB_PASSWORD="pass'word"     ✓ Use double quotes if password has single quotes
